# MultipleLanguages
This project demonstrates how to create a simple, dynamic multilingual website using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to switch between different languages without reloading the page. The text for each language is stored in a separate `translations.json` file, making the content easy to manage and scale.
